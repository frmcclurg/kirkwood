   "... virtually everything that truly qualifies a person
   for leadership is directly related to character. It's
   not about style, status, personal charisma, clout,
   or worldly measurements of success. Integrity is
   the main issue that makes the difference between
   a good leader and a bad one." -- John MacArthur
