<h4>I Have a Decided Heart</h4>

<p>My destiny is assured</p>

<h5>Today I Will Choose To Be Happy</h5>

<p>I am the possessor of a greatful heart</p>

<h6>I Will Greet This Day With a Forgiving Spirit</h6>

<p>I will forgive myself</p>

<h7>I Will Persist Without Exception</h7>

<p>I will find a way where there is no way</p>
