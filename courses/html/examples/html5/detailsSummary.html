   <summary>To the Scarecrow, a Brain</summary>

   <p>Why, anybody can have a brain. That's a very mediocre commodity. Every
   pusillanimous creature that crawls on the Earth or slinks through slimy seas
   has a brain. Back where I come from, we have universities, seats of great
   learning, where men go to become great thinkers. And when they come out, they
   think deep thoughts and with no more brains than you have! But they have one
   thing you haven't got - a diploma. Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested
   in me by the Universitatus Committeatum E Pluribus Unum, I hereby confer upon
   you the honorary degree of Th. D...that's Doctor of Thinkology.</p>

   <summary>To the Cowardly Lion, Courage</summary>

   <p>As for you, my fine friend, you're a victim of disorganized thinking. You
   are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger,
   you have no courage. You're confusing courage with wisdom. Back where I come
   from, we have men who are called heroes. Once a year, they take their fortitude
   out of moth balls and parade it down the main street of the city and they have
   no more courage than you have. But they have one thing that you haven't got - a
   medal. Therefore, for meritorious conduct, extraordinary valor, conspicuous
   bravery against Wicked Witches, I award you the Triple Cross. You are now a
   member of the Legion of Courage.</p>

   <summary>To the Tin Woodsman, a Heart</summary>
   <p>Back where I come from, there are men who do nothing all day but good deeds.
   They are called phila-, er, er, philanth-er, yes, er, good-deed doers, and their
   hearts are no bigger than yours. But they have one thing you haven't got - a
   testimonial. Therefore, in consideration of your kindness, I take pleasure at
   this time in presenting you with a small token of our esteem and affection. And
   remember, my sentimental friend, that a heart is not judged by how much you love,
   but by how much you are loved by others.</p>
